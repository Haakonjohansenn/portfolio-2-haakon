A simple overview of the use/purpose of the project.

## Description

To start the project off, i checked out a few different portfolio's to see if i could get some inspiration. I found a couple of portfolio's that i liked, but still wanted to make it my own, and not copy someone else. For the design i started up figma and went for a design, but i felt that it was very simple and way too friendly, so i decided to completely change it into something more ''risky'' and more visually interesting. for the hero-section as i called it, i wanted a picture of my self, that was one thing i liked from a lot of different portfolio's i looked at, so i decided to go for that as well. Besides that i kept it simple with some text beside, and to finish off i threw in a little animation just to make it more ''lively''.

For the project section i had a clear vision of how i wanted it to be after a lot of thinking and re-doing, and i am quite happy with the turnout in the end. I really like the hover effect where you switch up the visual content when hovering, so i was 100% certain that was the style i wanted to go for. It took me quite a long time to make the image and container fit the image inside the way i wanted to, and also make sure it flexed in the right way. I decided to throw in some orange on the ''cta-buttons'', this was not in the coolors palette i got, but i thought it looked nice with the colors i had already.

The about section i kept very simple and clean, i did not want to mess with it alot because i want to make it easy to read and focus on. Not much to say here, i went for a title with a little extra css to make it somewhat interesting, but that's about it.

For my contact section i kept it very simple too, i just wanted to throw in my contact info so people can get in contact with me easily, incase they like my work and have any questions. For later i want to fix my portfolio over time and make it look very good. I am happy with it now, but know i can fix alot of details and put more effort in to make it look top notch!
